## A range of 300 values can be from -150 to 150, divide by 100, the range is now from -1.5 to 1.5
## range of 30 values from -15 to 15, divide by 10 now -1.5 to 1.5

# gordan wants me to get theta values from each user's first attempt at a test
# I am supposed to use this information to figure out what the pass/fail score
# should be on a student's first attempt at a test

# practice a join command on two seperate tables!!! that may help in keeping all the data in one place

# Make an empty results database with user and theta columns
# You assume a test_id that you will do the task for
# Load the sessions data table
# Filter the sessions data table for the test_id
# Loop through the lines
# Grab the user_id
# Check if the user_id is in the results database
# If no
# Get the id (session id)
# load response database
# filter response database on session id = id
# if number of responses is >= 30
# 	i.     calculate theta (this will require writing a few lines of code and pulling p values from the question bank
# 	ii.     put user_id and theta into the results database
# Sort the results database by theta
# Graph the theta scores (probably binned like a histogram if itâ€™s easy)
# Get the theta corresponding to 70% being higher than that theta
